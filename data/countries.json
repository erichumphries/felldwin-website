The most major of the more distant events was that Odera was the site of many of the battles in the war between giants and dragons. That was centuries ago, but some of the remnants of when dragons ruled can still be seen today. A more recent event on Oderan soil was the war between Odera and the Bal’ad Dynasty. The Dynasty wished to expand their borders, and invaded the area around Shadehollow. The war raged on for 3 years, but was suddenly ended by the new High King, Bernard Eaglehair, after he took the throne when his father passed away suddenly. Peace was achieved through a gift, Bernard gifted a powerful magic item to the Dynasty, in exchange, the war was halted, and the Bal’ad Dynasty would not pursue Odera’s land. Peace was achieved between the two nations, but the relationship between the two was heavily damaged, many of the Oderan people heavily disdain those from Bal’ad, and the same is true for the Bal’ad people. Since then, the nation has lived in peace with the High King Bernard Eaglehair at the head of the nation.",

The stories say that the kingdom was founded by Verter Moonmantle, a powerful warrior, who also had a grasp on dangerous magic spells. He rose to power through the discovery of a powerful magic item. Once in control of the land, he enslaved the many people in the country to build cities and temples. He ruled for 200 years before being usurped by Amwin Eaglehair, who led a revolution against the tyrant. Amwin himself fought Verter on top of what is now known as Eaglepeak Mountain using a magical weapon he had found. The battle was fierce but Amwin and his revolution emerged victorious. After overthrowing Verter with the power of his own magical weapon, he shattered both, Amwin’s split into several different weapons, while Verter’s split into multiple pieces. Amwin was appointed king of the newly founded nation of Odera, but passed away a few months after due to his injuries. The nation prospered under the rule of the Eaglehair family, the days of the week being named after the most notable, but most of their stories are lost to time. To this day there is a celebration of the liberation of Odera on the first Amwin of the year. The previous king, who ruled for 60 years, was Sebastian Eaglehair. His rule was mostly calm until the invasion of the Bal’ad Dynasty to the East."
